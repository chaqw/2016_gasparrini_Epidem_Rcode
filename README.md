### Updated R code from Gasparrini, Epidemiology 2016

A simulation study comparing methods to model lagged effects in environmental time series, specifically moving averages and distributed lag models. The code fully reproduces the results illustrated in the article:

Gasparrini A. Modelling lagged associations in environmental time series data: a simulation study. *Epidemiology*. 2016; **27**(6):835-842. [[freely available here]](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2016_gasparrini_epidem.html)

The code:

  * *example.R* offers an example of simulation of the data, fit of the models, and          display/summary of the results
  * the numbered files from *00.prep.R* to *05.supplemenatary*, to be run sequentially,      fully reproduces the results of the simulation study presented in the manuscript
